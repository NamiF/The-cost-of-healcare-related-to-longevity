# The cost of Healthcare and its efficiency - Longevity

The ageing population and the healthcare cost related to this issue is one of the top concerns of our age.
<a href='https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy#life-expectancy-and-healthy-life-expectancy'>A study from Our World in Data</a> shows the clear up-rising life expectancy and it's cost.

From this data available, I would like to make further exploratory data analysis to see if there is any country, demonstrating more effective use of Healthcare cost to maintain its longevity than other countries.
